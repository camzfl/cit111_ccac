A collection of practice code and projects for CIT111: Introduction to Programming Java

I used to be an automotive technician and graduated from CCAC, i was injured and could no longer work on vehicles so i began to take up programming. For hobbies i play guitar and occasionally video games. My favorite sport is hockey and my favorite team is the Pittsburgh Penguins
